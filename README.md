# CuteDAQ 
## python 

This code includes several classes that can be used to acquire data from a Gantner Q.Gate controller over a TCP socket and writes the data to a csv file. The implementation is written using the standard python3 library (although it should be backwards compatible with python2, but this hasn't been tested)

To run the code:
```
python3 main.py
```
